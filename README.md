Mule Validation Module
=========================

A common issue when receiving data either electronically or from user input is verifying the integrity of the data. This work is repetitive and becomes even more complicated when different sets of validation rules need to be applied to the same set of data based on locale. This module addresses some of these issues to speed development and maintenance of validation rules.
